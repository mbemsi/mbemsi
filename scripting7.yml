Automating IT processes/workloads with GUI/CLI and Scripting
=============================================================
Automating IT:
   processes
   workloads 
   jobs    
   tasks  

We need computer systems to carryout tasks:
===========================================
Computer/systems:
  1. Bare Metal / HardWare components 
      RAM - memory 
      Cpu 
      ROM - hard disk / volume / storage 
      MOUSE
      KEYBOARD
      Screen
  2. Software components 
      operating system = OS [This is the heart a computer] : 
        Windows OS [ 7/xp/8/9/10/11 ]
        MacOS 
        Solaris  
        Linux  OS:
          Radhat 6/7/8/9 / 
          ubuntu  [16/18/20/22] / 
          centos 6/7/8/9 / 
          debain / amazon Linux / suse / etc.  
      and
      other softwares :
         shell 
         Sublime text
         mobaXterm / gitbash / telegram /    
         Microsoft word/Excell  

Examples of workloads:
  fileMGT / userMGT / packageMGT/ securityMGT / systemMGT / etc.

Workload management on Computer systems [LINUX OS] :
    GUI: = Graphical user interface  -- 5%
    CLI: = command line interface    -- 
            aws ec2 describe-instances  
     Linux OS = Linux servers/systems
      ls:   = list the content of a directory
      touch test.txt

    scripts: a shell-script is a collection of one or more commands in a file 
             a script is a file containing commands  
    write a simple script that welcomes Engineers to work?
    welcome.sh
    ==========
     #!/bin/bash 
     echo "Good morning"
     whoami
     echo "Welcome to Landmark Technologies" 
     echo "Today is"
     date

-bash: ./welcome.sh: Permission denied
[oke@demo22 ~]$ ll
-rw-r--r--. 1 oke oke 107 May 18 19:42 welcome.sh
 644 Permissions  
 The file/script need executable Permissions to run  
    chmod 744 welcome.sh  
    chmod  u+x scriptName 
    chmod   +x scriptName  
   [oke@demo22 ~]$ ll
   -rwx-r--r--. 1 oke oke 107 May 18 19:42 welcome.sh
Assign executable Permission:
  chmod +x fileName   
  chmod +x script1.sh
  chmod 775 fileName 
  chmod 700 fileName 

    shell: A shell is an interpreter that interpretes commands to the OS. 

shells command interpreters:
  Boune Shell  (sh)
  Boune Again Shell (bash)
  csh / ksh / tsh / zsh  

  echo $SHELL       =  List your current shell

Bash shell Scripting:

Naming convention:
Naming conventions best practices:
bash Shell-scripts   = script.sh or hello.sc  
Shell-scripts has '.sc' or '.sh' extensions 
    scriptname.sh  or 
    scriptName.sc or 
    *.sh or 
    *.sc 
  deploy.sh  = Shell-script [*.sh]
  test.txt   = text file    [*.txt]

using variables in scripting:
============================
name=SimonLegah
cpy=LandmarkTechnology
how to call variables in bash shell scripting:
  $variableName 
  ${variableName} 

var1.sh  
[oke@demo22 ~]$ cat var1.sh
#!/bin/bash
name=SimonLegah
cpy=LandmarkTechnology
echo "Good morning $name"
echo "Good morning ${name}"
echo Welcome to $cpy
echo Good morning ${name}, welcome to $cpy.

variables:
variables are defined by the either the user or the system 
we can refer/call a variable with $variable 

User defined variables   = UDV  : 
 Are defined/created by some admins  
udv.sh  
 name=SimonLegah
 cpy=LandmarkTechnology  
 city=Toronto
 country=Canada  
 echo $name works for $cpy located in $city, $country    

system defined variables   = SDV  : 
 SDV Are variables that comes with the OS  
 Such variables are in uppercase  
  SHELL=bin/bash
  echo $SHELL  = /bin/bash
  env = List all system defined variables  

sdv.sh 
city=Toronto
APP=TeslaApplication
echo $USER works for LandmarkTechnology, $city
echo $PWD
echo $SHELL
echo This $APP is the best version in the market.
# udv are or should be written in lowercase. Highly recomended
# sdv  are written in upper case

[oke@demo22 ~]$ env
SHELL=/bin/bash
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
SYSTEMD_COLORS=false
HISTSIZE=1000
HOSTNAME=demo22
PWD=/home/oke
LOGNAME=oke
HOME=/home/oke

start writing your script with shebang [#!] /bin/sh]

MTN =    


   export class=DevOpsMasterClass

system defined variables:
  echo sdv starts  
   echo $HISTSIZE  
   echo $USER 
   echo $HOME  
   echo $PATH  
   echo $LOGNAME
   echo $SHELL 
echo sdv ends   

[oke@demo22 ~]$  echo $HISTSIZE
                 1000
export HISTSIZE=2000
=============================

dynamic script  :
  1. echo $name Welcome to $cpy  

static script:
  1. echo Oke Welcome to MTN    

$name Welcome to Landmark Technology

User defined variables:
var1.sh 
   name=SimonLegah 
   cpy=LandmarkTechnology
   echo $name Welcome to $cpy  

write a script to authenticate bank users:
===========================================
[oke@demo22 ~]$ cat read1.sh
echo 'Please enter your name'
read name
echo "$name, welcome to TD Bank"
echo 'please enter your card'
echo 'please enter your pin'
read pin
echo "$pin is the correct pin, $name, how may we help you today?"

======================================
TICKET0045: Write a scipt to dynamically create users. 
   userMGT commands: adduser / usermod / userdel /  groupadd / groupdel 
      sudo adduser/userdel/usermod/ groupadd / groupdel 
userCreate.sh  
[oke@demo22 ~]$ cat createuser.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script requires root/sudo access
echo "Please enter the name of the newUser"
read newuser
echo "Now ready to create $newuser account "
sudo adduser  $newuser
echo "$newuser account is created successfully"
grep $newuser /etc/passwd # to verify
[oke@demo22 ~]$

IQ: Explain your experience in shell scripting  ?
1. using bash shell scripts for userMGT. 100% [New Graduate]    
2. In my environment/company/Landmark i use scripting for userMGT for over 5 years. 

userMGT.sh  :   
echo "creating a newuser account" 
echo "enter the new username's name"
read name  
sudo adduser $name 
sudo usermod -aG manager $name   
id $name 

bank.sh   
-------
echo "Please enter your name"
read name
echo "$name, welcome to TB Bank"
echo "Please enter your pin"
read -s pin  # -s pass a secret variable
echo "$name you entered an invalid pin"
[obi@sc ~]$

Security is inherent in our environment.  

Command Line Arguments = CLAs  
===============================
TICKET0047: write a script to backup databases in our environment.  
touch db_backup.sh
 echo "echo database backup initiated" > db_backup.sh
 echo "echo database backup completed" >> db_backup.sh

-# sh script.sh  arg1  arg2  arg3 ...  agr10
-#     $o         $1    $2    $3       $10

cla.sh   
#echo please pass 3 arguments with your script
echo "The 1st argument is $1"
echo "The 2nd argument is $2"
echo "The 10th argument is ${10}"
echo The number argument is $#
echo The list of  argument are $@
echo The list of  argument are $*
Date
echo The status of your last run command is $?
mkdir backup
cp *  backup/
echo The process id is  $$


[oke@demo22 ~]$ echo $?
127
[oke@demo22 ~]$ cat ss
cat: ss: No such file or directory
[oke@demo22 ~]$ echo $?
1

IQ: What is the significance of $? in scripting.
  It gives the status of your last run command.
  The value can be = 0 [Its okay]   or 
  The value can be = 1-127 [Its not okay]   

[oke@demo22 ~]$ ls
app      cla.sh         db_backup.sh  mlc.sh      sdv1.sh  usermgt.sh
backup   comment.sh     deploy.sh     read1.sh    sdv2.sh  var1.sh
bank.sh  createuser.sh  deployment    script1.sh  udv1.sh  welcome.sh
[oke@demo22 ~]$ echo $? = 0
[oke@demo22 ~]$ LS
-bash: LS: command not found
[oke@demo22 ~]$ echo $? = 127
[oke@demo22 ~]$ cat ss
cat: ss: No such file or directory
[oke@demo22 ~]$ echo $? = 1


command Line arguments:
    The 1st argument is  = $1"
    The 2nd argument is  = $2"
    The 3rd argument is  = $3"
    The 6th argument is  = $6"
    The scriptName  is   = $0"
    The 10th argument is = ${10}"
    The number argument is $#
    The list of argument are $@
    The list of argument are $*
    The status of the last run command is = $?  
    The process id is = $$  

CLA = $? displays the status of your   
  last run command with 2 possible values 
     $? = 0 = command ran successfully
     $? = 1-127 = something is wrong        

  1-127 are error codes :
      1   = 
      2   = 
      3   = 
      127 = 

An argument, also called command line argument, 
can be defined as input given to a command line 
to process that input with the help of given command. 
Argument can be in the form of a file or directory. 
Arguments are entered in the terminal or console after entering command.

Inequality signs :
=================
-eq  or  == represent equals to 
           (( $? == 0 )) [ X -eq = y]
-ne  or  != represent not equals to 
-gt  or  >  represent greater than
-lt  or  <  represent less than 
-ge  or >= greater than or equals to
-le  0r <= less than  or equals to

USING Scripts for package management:
====================================
We can install, remove, updates and 
upgrade packages in our servers.
examples of packages:
  nano, tree, vim, httpd, 
  java, maven, tomcat, jenkins,
  kubernetes, kubelet, docker
  terraform, etc.  
We can download and install packages 
using package managers like:
   yum/dnf          -- centos, redhat
   apt/apt-get      -- ubuntu, debain
   chocolatey/choco -- windows OS  
   brew             --  mac  
   helm,  -- kubernetes 
   pip,   -- python 
   rpm
